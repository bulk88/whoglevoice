I'm not accusing you personally of running scripts on my site, or performing an abusive act, but my scripts detected some unusual behavior from your IP address, and this is why you're getting this page right now.<br>
All I ask of you is to prove you're a human being, and you can do so by entering the phrase displayed in the graphic into the box below. Then we can be on our way with things.<br>
Thanks!<br>

<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6Le5FVcUAAAAAAvmlU25QM27A9Idifg0B3X_bWjN"></div>
	<input type="submit" value="Unlock site"></form><br/>
If you haven't checked, I have APIs that allow you to make lightweight queries of my database in a non cpu or database intensive way.<br>
Check out my external query interface <a href="https://www.telcodata.us/docs/queries.html">here</a>.
Additionally for a minimal fee, you could be downloading the data onto your own system, not only making your site not dependent on mine, but improving your user experience by decreasing latency.<br/>
